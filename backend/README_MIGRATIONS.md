# Database Migrations - Future Implementation

## Current State
The project currently uses SQLAlchemy's `Base.metadata.create_all()` for automatic table creation on startup. This is suitable for development but NOT recommended for production.

## Why Alembic is Not Yet Used
1. **Development Phase**: Schema is still evolving rapidly
2. **Single Developer**: No team coordination needed yet
3. **SQLite Database**: Easy to reset during development
4. **No Production Data**: No risk of data loss

## When to Add Alembic
Add proper migrations when:
- Moving to production with real user data
- Multiple developers working on schema changes
- Need for schema version control and rollback capability
- Deploying to staging/production environments

## Migration Strategy (Future)
```bash
# Install Alembic
pip install alembic

# Initialize Alembic
alembic init alembic

# Configure alembic.ini with DATABASE_URL
# Edit alembic/env.py to import Base from database.py

# Create initial migration
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial schema"

# Apply migrations
alembic upgrade head

# For production deployments
alembic upgrade head  # Run before starting application
```

## Best Practices for Future Migrations
1. Always review autogenerated migrations before applying
2. Test migrations on staging data before production
3. Create backups before major schema changes
4. Document breaking changes in migration messages
5. Use separate migration environments for dev/staging/prod
